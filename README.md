# NFT Preview Card Component

This repository contains my solution to the **NFT preview card component** challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U).  The goal of the challenge is to replicate a given design for an NFT card and practise writing clean, responsive HTML and CSS.

## Features

* **Pixel‑perfect layout** – Carefully matches the provided design with attention to spacing, colours and typography.
* **Responsive and accessible** – The layout adapts to different screen sizes using Flexbox, and semantic HTML ensures screen readers can interpret the content.
* **Interactive states** – Includes hover and focus states for the image and textual elements to improve the user experience.

## Tech Stack

* **HTML5** – Semantic markup for the component structure.
* **CSS3** – Custom styles utilising Flexbox and the `:hover` pseudo‑class; no frameworks or libraries are used.
